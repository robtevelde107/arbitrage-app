"""
This script launches the virtual agent team for the arbitrage app. It reads configuration
from environment variables defined in the `.env` file (PWA_URL, PYTHONANYWHERE_USERNAME,
and PYTHONANYWHERE_PASSWORD), verifies they are present, and performs a real
connectivity check to the Progressive Web App (PWA) endpoint. If the PWA URL is reachable,
the script proceeds to log in information for the PythonAnywhere deployment account.

In a full implementation, this script would then orchestrate a team of AI agents to
build and deploy the arbitrage application. For now, it ensures that credentials
are loaded correctly and that the PWA endpoint is accessible, forming the foundation
for further development.
